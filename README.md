# Bharat-Intern-App-Development-Task-2-Temperature-Converter-App
This is my Bharat Intern App Development Internship Task - 2 of making a Temperature Converter App. This app is made in Java programming language using Android Studio.

If you want to run this app in your system then you can directly clone the repository in your system and then open that cloned repository folder in Android Studio and then you can run the app in Android Studio Mobile Phone Emulator by clicking on run button. \
\
or \
\
If you want to run this app on your physical mobile phone then instead of cloning the whole repository just download the .apk file named "Temperature Converter.apk" listed above and then run it by simply clicking on it in your mobile phone, your phone might block its installation as this application is getting installed from outside of the Play Store but don't worry it is totally safe just give it necessary permissions to run and install and after installation you can simply use it like any other app you use in your mobile phone.
